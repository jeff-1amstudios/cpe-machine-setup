# C++ Collaborative Programming Exercise Setup
 
## Instructions

This program requires C++ (standard language 11) and CMake 3.6.x.

For compilation and execution, the first step is to generate the Makefile to compile. This can be done by executing:

```
cmake .
```
Then, you are ready to compile the binary by executing:

```
make clean
make
```
This will generate the `cpe-machine-setup` binary.  Run the binary to see an error output.  Fix the code to get the success output and you are ready to program on-site!

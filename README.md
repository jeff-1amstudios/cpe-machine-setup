# MuleSoft Collaborative Programming Exercise (CPE) Machine Setup
Prepare your machine, and yourself, for the MuleSoft collaborative programming exercise (CPE) interview described here: https://www.mulesoft.com/careers/engineer-interview

If you plan on using one of our loaner laptops for the exercise then this pre-interview dry run is not as important.  Otherwise, we recommend performing this basic setup to ensure you hit the ground running when you get on-site for the interview.

Contained in this repo are a collection of simple `hello world` style applications in various languages each with a simple unit test.  Your goals here are simple:

1. Pick *ONE* language you'd like to use during the interview from one of our pre-set options in this repo and enter into that language's directory
2. Import that langage's sample app into your favorite IDE or text editor
3. Compile/run the app and execute the unit test
4. Fix the unit test to make it pass when run again

That's it!  You're now prepared for some on-site interview programming.
